This project uses a dataset of Portuguese secondary school students to build a machine learning model that predicts students' final grades (G3) based on academic performance, study habits, and demographic factors. It applies linear regression to selected numeric and categorical features after proper preprocessing (encoding binary and categorical variables). The model is trained, evaluated, and tested for accuracy, and predictions are compared to actual results.

Technologies used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
